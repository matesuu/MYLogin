# MYLogin

MYLogin is a easy to use CLI tool that saves login information and credentials for reliability and personal convience. This is a side project I started working on a few months ago. Originally, the concept was to be a standalone application complete with a GUI for ease of use, but the final product is now CLI utility that aims to be efficient and reliable as opposed to graphically complex, whilst still retaining a high degree of usability. This is the first largescale project I've worked on in the context of open source development, so feel free to implement improvements as desired. More to come soon.
