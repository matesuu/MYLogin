# LoginManager

This is a side project I started working on a few days ago. Currently, it's only meant to be run as a cmd line utility in mac or linux but hopefully I get to making a GUI soon. All the basic functionality is worked out at the moment, so I guess the next step would be to refine some of the user stuff and maybe add one or two more features. Next steps after that would be to add automated login support so that you can login from terminal(will have to work out selenium for that). Hopefully this goes well. Pretty new to this so any suggestions are welcome
