1. Getting Started

This manual will serve as a quick guide to using the MYLogin CLI, mainly for beginners unfamiliar with the command line. To start, we must ensure an installation of a given Python3 exists on the local device that MYLogin will run on. To start the application navigate to the local directory in which the MYLogin folder and do as follows:

my_username:~$ cd MYLogin
my_username:~$ python3 -m login

NOTE: 

Do not modify the naming conventions of any Folders (i.e. Data/Backups/Logs) as it sets these as predefined names within source code.
Will modify this in the future but for now dont modify names.

2. Common Errors:

Here is a list of errors and the documentation behind them:

error: file not found - indicates that the file that user is attempting to restore from does not exist within Backups folder

error: could not locate client - client information could not be found, therefore it does not exist in current repository of names

fatal: invalid JSON format (filename.json) - occurs when given JSON file is not formatted correctly and cannot be parsed. For reference, use to default github JSON files or reformat manually

fatal: file error - file is not in a supported format (i.e. file is not JSON and uses an unknown or invalid extension)
